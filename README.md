Library Management API Specification provides an OpenAPI 3.1.0-based design for managing books and authors. It includes CRUD endpoints, filtering by book name, release date, or author name, and integrates with SwaggerHub (mock server) and Postman (testing). Fully documented schemas ensure easy implementation and testing.
